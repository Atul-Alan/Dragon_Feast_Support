# Dragon Feast — Support Site

Static support site ready for GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or any static host.

## Quick Start
- Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.
- After hosting, update the Open Graph URL and sitemap base in files that reference `https://example.com/dragon-feast-support`.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a new repo (e.g., `dragon-feast-support`).
2. Commit the contents of this folder.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, pick `main` branch, `/ (root)`.
4. Your site will be live at `https://<yourname>.github.io/dragon-feast-support/`.

## Deploy to Netlify
- Drag & drop the folder at https://app.netlify.com/drop or connect your Git repo.

## Update Contact Email
- Edit the `mailto:` links in `index.html` (search for `dragonfeast.support@gmail.com`).

## Google Sites
- Google Sites does not host raw HTML, but you can:
  - paste the content sections into a new Site, or
  - embed your hosted page: **Insert → Embed → URL** (use your GitHub Pages/Netlify URL).
